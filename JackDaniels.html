    <p class="producttext">Jack Daniel's is a brand of Tennessee whiskey and the top-selling American whiskey in the world. It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee, by the Jack Daniel Distillery, which has been owned by the Brown–Forman Corporation since 1956. Jack Daniel's
        home county of Moore is a dry county, so the product is not available for purchase at stores or restaurants within the county. Jack Daniel's and Cola 375mL can The product meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight bourbon,
        though the company disavows this classification. It markets the liquor simply as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon. As defined in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Tennessee whiskey is classified as a straight bourbon authorized
        to be produced in the state of Tennessee. Tennessee law (57-2-106) further requires most producers of Tennessee whiskey to filter the spirit through charcoal made from maple prior to aging, in addition to meeting the above requirements (the "Lincoln
        County Process"). Packaged in square bottles, Jack Daniel's "Black Label" Tennessee whiskey sold 12.5 million cases in the 2017 fiscal year, which ended on April 30, 2017.[clarification needed][11] Other brand variations, such as Tennessee Honey,
        Gentleman Jack, and Tennessee Fire, added another 2.9 million cases to sales. Sales of an additional 800,000 equivalent cases in ready-to-drink (RTD) products brought the fiscal year total to more than 16.1 million equivalent adjusted cases for
        the entire Jack Daniel's family of brands.
